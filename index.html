		<p> The Chinese dragon is a symbol of China, and it is an important part of Chinese culture. Chinese dragons symbolize wisdom, power, and wealth, and they are believed to bring good luck.

In ancient times, when there was no rain for a long time, people prayed for rain with a dragon dance, and dragon dances after planting were also a way to pray against insect attacks. Nowadays, dragon dances are performed during festive occasions as a means to chase away evil spirits and welcome in prosperous times.
