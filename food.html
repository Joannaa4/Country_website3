		<p>As Mapo tofu became popular outside China, it is often presented in restaurants with various adaptations. Some of these alterations are modest while the others are quite dramatic. Today’s Mapo tofu recipe reflects the way this dish is traditionally prepared in terms of the flavour, spice level and texture.</p>

		<p> Baozi (Chinese: 包子ⓘ), or simply bao, is a type of yeast-leavened filled bun[1] in various Chinese cuisines. There are many variations in fillings (meat or vegetarian) and preparations, though the buns are most often steamed. They are a variation of mantou from Northern China.

Baozi are popular throughout China and have even made their way into the cuisines of many other countries through the Chinese diaspora.</p>

		<p>Red braised pork belly or hong shao rou (simplified Chinese: 红烧肉; traditional Chinese: 紅燒肉; pinyin: hóngshāoròu) is a classic pork dish from China, red-cooked using pork belly and a combination of ginger, garlic, aromatic spices, chilis, sugar, star anise, light and dark soy sauce, and rice wine. The pork belly is cooked until the fat and skin are gelatinous, soft, and melt easily in the mouth, while the sauce is usually thick, sweet and fairly sticky. The dish has a melt-in-the-mouth texture that is formed as a result of a long braising process, during which the liquid reduces and becomes thick. It is generally served with steamed rice and dark green vegetables, often over holidays.</p>
